### Hotfixes / Operational

- ☑ Oct 2, 2025 — Ko‑fi widget overlay blanking the app <!-- id:ops.kofi_overlay_fix -->
  - Cause: Ko‑fi Widget_2.js injected a full‑screen iframe overlay that remained visible (white), likely due to a script/CSS interaction. Reproduced locally and on Render.
  - Fix: Removed widget script entirely and replaced with a simple Ko‑fi link button in components/SupportWidgets.tsx; added a cleanup effect to strip any previously injected Ko‑fi overlays on load. CSP left as report‑only.

☑ Admin: Badges summary (approx) <!-- id:admin.badges_summary -->
  - Linked from admin/JustForDavy; rough counts OK.
☑ Admin: Events Debug panel <!-- id:admin.events_debug -->
  - Totals, badge counts (Mathlete/Scenario/Mull Master) and top users via /api/admin/events/summary.
  - New page /admin/badges sampling recent public decks to estimate counts (Brewer tiers, Combomancer); extender-ready for jobs.

☑ Price Tracker center chart renders and is centered; tooltip, zero-baseline Y, dots, and CSV export. <!-- id:price_tracker.chart_fixed -->
  - Replaced dynamic recharts imports with static imports to avoid SSR/dynamic timing issues.

☑ Inline feedback buttons on AI suggestions (👍/👎 + optional comment) <!-- id:ux.feedback_buttons -->

  - Implemented component and added tooltips on Probability, Mulligan, and Analyzer bands.
☑ Quick bug/feedback widget (bottom-right dock with screenshot + context auto-attached) <!-- id:ux.feedback_widget -->
☑ Public profile featured custom card (right rail) with art and badges showing properly <!-- id:profile.public_featured_card_badges -->
  - Status: Implemented. Wallet tile pin toggles to Pinned; public profile shows full-size preview in right rail; badges appear on banners; dynamic pages for live updates.
☑ Wishlist Editor v1 — tiles with thumbnails, prices, and +/- controls <!-- id:wishlist.editor_v1 -->
  - Status: Implemented. New wishlist API routes (items/update/remove); Profile → Wishlist tab renders grid with card thumbnails, price per unit (currency selectable), quantity +/- controls, remove, total; add-by-name using existing add endpoint. Legacy textarea retained under details for quick paste/backups.
☑ Wishlist Editor v2 — typeahead, hover previews, CSV, sticky header, batch remove, and name fixes <!-- id:wishlist.editor_v2 -->

  - Status: Implemented. Public decks left sidebar now includes Mana curve, Type distribution, Core needs meters (format-aware targets for Commander) and a Deck Value mini with currency selector (snapshot pricing). My Decks sidebar already had the meters; added a Deck Value mini there as well.
☑ Glossary & hover tooltips for MTG terms ("ramp," "midrange," etc.) <!-- id:ux.glossary_tooltips -->
☑ Probability & synergy charts (Deckstats/EDHREC-style, hoverable odds + synergy %) <!-- id:ux.prob_synergy_charts -->
☑ Probability helper refinements (K‑chips, play/draw, sensitivity, color solver, deep‑links, explainer, server color sources, advanced toggle persisted, detected summary) <!-- id:tools.prob_refine -->

Status: Completed and deployed.

Highlights
- Full UX redesign with clear, two-pane layout: fixed left controls, fluid right results. <!-- id:ctf.layout_two_pane -->
- Summary panel with Missing, Total cost, Biggest card, core category counts (Lands/Ramp/Draw/Removal) and Pro-only 30‑day sparkline. <!-- id:ctf.summary_cards -->

- Pro‑gated "Why?" per shopping row (AI explanation, portals above table). <!-- id:ctf.why_button_pro -->

Production hardening
- Proxy auth: forward cookies from /api/collections/cost-to-finish proxy so Render prod sessions are honored; solved 503 Upstream in prod only. <!-- id:ctf.proxy_cookie_fix -->
- CSRF origin relax: sameOriginOk now accepts host match and RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL; fixed like/unlike failing in prod. <!-- id:ctf.csrf_render_fix -->
- Nightly prewarm workflow hardened: BASE_URL secret check + curl -f with explicit POSTs; clear error messaging. <!-- id:ops.nightly_prewarm_hardening -->

- Z‑index flip (right above left) + removed overflow-hidden on ancestors; menus portal to body; no clipping. <!-- id:ctf.z_index_overflow -->
- Explicit width clamp only on right stack (Summary, Charts, and List share the same inner width): xl:max-w-[1100px], 2xl:max-w-[1300px]. <!-- id:ctf.unified_clamp -->
- Shopping list autoadjust: switched to table-auto; removed colgroup; cells wrap; non-essential cols (Source/Role/Tier/Link/Why) hidden at xl and shown at 2xl. No horizontal scrollbar at xl/2xl. <!-- id:ctf.table_auto_adjust -->
