For decks with many low-cost spells, 36 can suffice.\n\n3. **Color Distribution**: More colors typically require more lands for effective fixing.\n\n4. **Ramp & Draw**: Include ramp spells like [[Cultivate]] or mana rocks such as [[Arcane Signet]], and ensure you have card draw to maintain resource flow.\n\nEvaluate your land count based on these guidelines to avoid being too greedy!
