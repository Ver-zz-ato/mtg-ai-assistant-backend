# Building Budget EDH: 5 Hidden Gems Under $1

Building a competitive Commander deck doesn't mean you need to spend hundreds of dollars. There are plenty of powerful cards that fly under the radar and cost less than a dollar. Here are five hidden gems that can elevate your deck without breaking the bank.

## 1. **Arcane Signet** (~$0.50)

While Sol Ring gets all the glory, Arcane Signet is equally essential in any Commander deck. It produces mana of any color in your commander's color identity for just two mana. This card has been reprinted multiple times, keeping its price low while maintaining its power level.

**Why it's great:** Fixes your mana and ramps you at the same time. Works in any multi-color deck.

## 2. **Windfall** (~$0.75)

Card draw is crucial in Commander, and Windfall provides it in spades. For just three mana, you and each opponent discard your hands and draw seven cards. In decks that can leverage the graveyard or benefit from wheels, this is an absolute powerhouse.

**Why it's great:** Refills your hand, disrupts opponents with full hands, and enables graveyard strategies.

## 3. **Ghostly Prison** (~$0.85)

In multiplayer games, you need ways to discourage attacks. Ghostly Prison makes your opponents pay {2} for each creature attacking you. This buys you time and makes you a less appealing target.

**Why it's great:** Passive protection that lets you develop your board while others fight each other.

## 4. **Nature's Lore** (~$0.60)

Ramp is essential, and Nature's Lore is one of the best budget options. For two mana, you can search for any Forest - including dual lands with the Forest type - and put it directly onto the battlefield untapped.

**Why it's great:** Fetches shock lands, battle lands, or triomes. Comes in untapped unlike many budget ramp spells.

## 5. **Vandalblast** (~$0.40)

Artifact removal is crucial in Commander, and Vandalblast offers incredible flexibility. For one mana, it destroys target artifact. But its overload cost of seven mana destroys ALL artifacts your opponents control, potentially winning games on the spot.

**Why it's great:** Versatile early game, devastating late game. Single-handedly shuts down artifact-heavy strategies.

# Mastering the Mana Curve: The Foundation of Winning Deck Construction

Your mana curve is the single most important structural element of your Magic deck. Get it right, and your deck flows smoothly from turn to turn. Get it wrong, and you'll stumble over clunky hands and awkward draws. Let's break down how to build the perfect curve.

## What is a Mana Curve?

A mana curve is the distribution of mana costs across all cards in your deck. When you visualize it as a bar chart, you should see a smooth "curve" that peaks in the mid-game and tapers off toward expensive spells.

**Why it matters:** Your curve determines what you can do each turn. A well-built curve ensures you always have plays, while a bad curve leaves you with dead cards in hand.

## The 2-3-4 Rule for Commander

In Commander, follow this framework for a balanced 100-card deck:

- **2 mana (8-12 cards):** Ramp pieces that accelerate your gameplan. Think Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Nature's Lore, and other mana acceleration.
- **3 mana (12-15 cards):** Value engines and card draw. These are cards that generate advantage turn after turn—Rhystic Study, Phyrexian Arena, enchantments that stick around.
- **4 mana (10-14 cards):** Your first wave of threats. Board wipes, powerful creatures, or game-changing enchantments that establish your position.

## Early Game: Turns 1-3

Your early turns are about **setup, not winning**. Prioritize:

- **Ramp:** Lands, mana rocks, mana dorks. Getting ahead on mana wins games.
- **Card draw:** Setting up engines for sustained advantage later.
- **Early interaction:** Cheap removal or counters for opponent threats.

**Common mistake:** Skipping ramp because it "doesn't do anything." Wrong! Ramp lets you deploy your threats ahead of schedule, which *is* winning.

## Mid Game: Turns 4-6

This is where games are won or lost. Your curve should peak here with:

- **Threats:** Creatures, planeswalkers, or combo pieces that pressure opponents.
- **Board presence:** Multiple permanents that force opponents to react.
- **Protection:** Ways to defend your board or disrupt opponents.

**Common mistake:** Too many 6+ mana cards. If your hand is full of expensive bombs on turn 4, you're not playing the game yet.

## Late Game: Turn 7+

Your late-game cards should be **finishers**—cards that close out games when they resolve:

- Big mana haymakers (7-10 mana)
- Win conditions and combo pieces
- Game-ending board wipes or effects

**How many?** Only 4-8 cards should cost 7+ mana. Any more and you'll flood your hand with uncastable spells.

## Common Mana Curve Mistakes

### 1. Too Top-Heavy

**Problem:** Your deck is full of 6-8 mana bombs but nothing to do early.  
**Fix:** Cut 3-4 expensive cards for 2-3 mana ramp and interaction.

### 2. No Ramp

**Problem:** You're playing fair Magic while opponents are cheating on mana.  
**Fix:** Run 10-12 ramp pieces. Commander is a ramp format—embrace it.

### 3. Ignoring Interaction

**Problem:** Your curve is all threats and no answers.  
**Fix:** Include 8-10 removal spells spread across your curve. You need to interact to win.

# Building Competitive EDH on $100: The Complete Guide

Think you need deep pockets to play competitive Commander? Think again! With smart card choices and strategic building, you can construct a powerful EDH deck for under $100 that holds its own at most tables. Here's how.

## Why Budget Commander is Worth It

Building on a budget forces creativity and smart deckbuilding. You learn to maximize synergy, identify undervalued cards, and build resilient gameplans. Plus, budget decks are:

- **Upgradeable:** Start at $100, grow to $200, then $500 as you acquire pieces
- **Fun:** Winning with jank feels better than winning with cEDH staples
- **Accessible:** Get friends into the format without requiring a huge investment

## The $100 Breakdown Strategy

Here's how to allocate your budget across essential categories:

- **Lands ($10):** 35 basics + 2-3 budget duals (Command Tower, Exotic Orchard, etc.)
- **Ramp ($15):** Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Cultivate, Kodama's Reach, Wayfarer's Bauble
- **Removal ($15):** Beast Within, Generous Gift, Chaos Warp, board wipes
- **Card Draw ($20):** The bread and butter of Commander—never skimp here
- **Win Conditions ($20):** Your primary threats and combo pieces
- **Synergy Pieces ($20):** Cards that make your strategy hum

## Top 3 Budget Commander Picks

### 1. Zada, Hedron Grinder (~$0.25)

**Strategy:** Copy spells that target Zada to every creature you control  
**Budget Power:** Turn a $0.10 cantrip into drawing 10+ cards  
**Key Cards:** Crimson Wisps, Expedite, Fists of Flame, Young Pyromancer  
**Win Con:** Go-wide tokens + pump spell + Zada = lethal damage

**Why it's strong:** Explosive turns, cheap deck, resilient to removal. You can rebuild fast and goldfish wins on turn 5-6.

### 2. Talrand, Sky Summoner (~$0.30)

**Strategy:** Counter spells, make 2/2 flyers, beat down  
**Budget Power:** Every counterspell is also a threat  
**Key Cards:** Counterspell, Pongify, Rapid Hybridization, Mystic Sanctuary  
**Win Con:** 20+ flying drakes overwhelm opponents

**Why it's strong:** Plays control and wins through inevitability. Extremely budget-friendly since most of your deck is commons and uncommons.

### 3. Krenko, Mob Boss (~$1.50)

**Strategy:** Make infinite goblins, swing for lethal  
**Budget Power:** Exponential growth with tribal synergy  
**Key Cards:** Skirk Prospector, Goblin Chieftain, Siege-Gang Commander, Impact Tremors  
**Win Con:** Untap Krenko multiple times = massive goblin army

**Why it's strong:** Tribal decks are cheap to build, and Krenko can win out of nowhere. One untap and you've got 50+ goblins.

## Where to Save Money

### 1. Basics Over Duals

Shock lands and fetch lands are expensive. Basics are free. In 2-color decks, you can easily run 30+ basics and be perfectly fine. Save your budget for spells that win games.

### 2. Commons and Uncommons

Many of Magic's best cards are common rarity: Counterspell, Lightning Bolt, Rampant Growth, Opt. Don't overlook these workhorses.

### 3. Recent Reprints

Commander precons reprint powerful cards every year. Cards like Arcane Signet, Sol Ring, and Command Tower are now pennies thanks to reprints.

## Where to Splurge

### 1. Card Draw

Rhystic Study is expensive, but cheaper draw engines like Phyrexian Arena, Mystic Remora, and The Immortal Sun are worth prioritizing. Card advantage wins games.

### 2. Ramp

Sol Ring and Arcane Signet are cheap now, but even if they weren't, they'd be worth it. Getting ahead on mana is how you win Commander.

### 3. Your Commander

If your commander costs $5-10, it's probably worth it. Your commander is the one card you're guaranteed to have access to every game—make it count.

## The Upgrade Path: $100 → $200 → $500

**$100 to $200:** Upgrade your manabase. Add pain lands, check lands, and budget fetches like Evolving Wilds. Add 2-3 powerful staples (Cyclonic Rift, Dockside Extortionist).

**$200 to $500:** Now you can afford the big hitters. Tutors (Vampiric Tutor, Demonic Tutor), fast mana (Mana Crypt if you're feeling spicy), and format staples (Smothering Tithe, Rhystic Study).
