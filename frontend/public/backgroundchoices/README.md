# 🧪 LOCAL TESTING - Background Images

**This folder is for LOCAL TESTING ONLY - DO NOT COMMIT TO GITHUB**

## How to Use:

1. Put your 3 background images in this folder
2. Name them:
   - `bg1.png`
   - `bg2.png`
   - `bg3.png`
3. The background switcher will appear in the bottom-right corner when running locally (`npm run dev`)
4. Click buttons 1, 2, or 3 to switch between backgrounds
5. Your choice is saved in localStorage

## Important:

- ⚠️ These files are in `.gitignore` - they won't be committed
- 🧪 The switcher ONLY works in development mode
- 🚫 It will NOT appear in production builds
