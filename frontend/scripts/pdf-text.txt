etc.) to create infinite creature tokens. It checks if the AI recognizes the infinite Kiki-Jiki combo
and doesn't misclassify this as a midrange deck due to the mix of creature cards.

Focus: Tests the AI's recognition of a two-card infinite life-drain combo (Exquisite Blood +
Sanguine Bond). The deck's focus on lifegain and drain should be identified, ensuring the AI
notes the combo win condition instead of treating it as a generic lifegain deck.

• Mountain
• Mountain

Focus: A mono-red combo/Voltron deck that equips Helm of the Host to Godo to generate
infinite combat phases. It checks if the AI spots the infinite combat step combo and doesn't
miscategorize the deck as merely equipment-based aggro (even though it has many equipment
cards).
• Gitrog Dakmor Combo (Golgari) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: The Gitrog Monster):
• Dakmor Salvage
• Gitrog Monster (as card engine)

• Entomb
• Sol Ring
• Arcane Signet
• Golgari Signet
• Command Tower
• Overgrown Tomb
• Bayou
• Swamp
• Forest
Focus: A Graveyard combo deck using The Gitrog Monster. It tests if the AI detects the Dakmor
Salvage + Gitrog infinite draw combo (discarding Dakmor to draw repeatedly, potentially
milling the whole deck) and understands the deck's dredge/self-mill win condition, rather than
seeing it as a generic graveyard value deck.
• Basalt Monolith Infinite Mana (Simic) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Kinnan, Bonder
Prodigy):
• Basalt Monolith
• Mana Reflection
• Peregrine Drake
• Memnarch
4

• Breeding Pool
• Tropical Island
• Yavimaya Coast
• Island
• Forest
Focus: A Simic combo-ramp deck focused on generating infinite mana (Basalt Monolith + Kinnan
or Mana Reflection). It intentionally contains an off-color card (Aphemia, which has black) to test
if the AI catches the color identity violation. The main check is whether the AI notes the infinite
mana outlet (Ballista/Krasis) and flags the illegal inclusion.
• Doomsday Piles (Grixis) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Kess, Dissident Mage):
• Doomsday
• Thassa's Oracle
• Laboratory Maniac

• Volcanic Island
• Badlands
• Island
• Swamp
Focus: A Grixis Doomsday deck built to set up a winning five-card pile (usually finishing with
5
Thassa's Oracle or Lab Maniac). It tests the AI's ability to recognize the extremely compact
Doomsday combo and the requirement of precise sequencing, rather than missing the combo
and treating the deck as a generic spell-heavy control.
• Underworld Breach Storm (Jeskai) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Elsha of the
Infinite):
• Underworld Breach
• Lion's Eye Diamond
• Brain Freeze
• Wheel of Fortune
• Narset, Parter of Veils

• Talisman of Progress
• Volcanic Island
• Tundra
• Plateau
• Command Tower
• Mystic Monastery
Focus: A Jeskai storm combo deck that uses Underworld Breach with Brain Freeze and Lion's Eye
Diamond to loop spells. It checks if the AI spots the Breach storm combo (infinite self-mill and
recast) and the presence of protective pieces (Narset to stop opponents' draws), rather than just
calling it a spellslinger deck without noting the combo.
• Flash Hulk (5c cEDH) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Kenrith, the Returned King):
• Flash (banned)
• Protean Hulk
• Viscera Seer
• Mikaeus, the Unhallowed

• City of Brass
• Mana Confluence
• Savannah
• Underground Sea
• Volcanic Island
• Plateau
• Bayou
Focus: A top-tier cEDH combo list using the infamous Flash + Protean Hulk combo (with Flash
banned in Commander). It tests the AI's ability to flag the banned card and to identify the fast
win condition (Protean Hulk fetching Mikaeus + Ballista for infinite damage) amid the deck's
many protective elements.
• Birthing Pod Chain (Simic) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Prime Speaker Vannifar):

• Tropical Island
• Breeding Pool
• Forest
• Island
Focus: A Simic creature-combo deck that uses Vannifar/Birthing Pod chains to tutor up an
infinite combo (ending with Kiki-Jiki + a untapper like Pestermite). It checks if the AI follows the
creature tutor chain to the combo finish, rather than misreading the deck as just value-
oriented for ETB effects.
• Mikaeus + Triskelion (Mono-Black) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Sidisi, Undead
Vizier):
• Mikaeus, the Unhallowed
• Triskelion
7
• Walking Ballista

• Reanimate
• Exsanguinate
• Gray Merchant of Asphodel
• Crypt Ghast
• Cabal Coffers
• Jet Medallion
• Sol Ring
• Phyrexian Arena
• Necropotence
• Toxic Deluge
• Command Tower
• Swamp
• Swamp
• Swamp
• Swamp
• Swamp
Focus: A mono-black combo deck designed to pull off the Mikaeus + Triskelion infinite damage
combo. The AI should catch that Mikaeus (giving undying) plus Triskelion can generate infinite
damage, and not just describe the deck as generic reanimator or mono-black control. It also
tests identification of the deck's heavy tutor package (Sidisi, Buried Alive, etc.) supporting the
combo.
• Lab Maniac Self-Mill (Dimir) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Phenax, God of Deception):
• Laboratory Maniac
• Leveler
• Thassa's Oracle
• Traumatize
• Keening Stone
• Altar of Dementia

• Mesmeric Orb
• Mind Grind
• Pact of Negation
• Damnation
• Sol Ring
• Dimir Signet
• Command Tower
• Drowned Catacomb
• Watery Grave
• Island
8
• Swamp
Focus: A Dimir self-mill deck that can win by emptying its own library and using Lab Maniac/
Thassa's Oracle. It tests if the AI notices the plan of self-mill to win (with Leveler instantly exiling
the library, for example) and the alternate win conditions, instead of treating Phenax as purely a
defensive mill card or missing the Lab Maniac trigger entirely.
• Worldgorger Dragon Combo (Rakdos) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Prosper, Tome-
Bound):
• Worldgorger Dragon
• Animate Dead
• Dance of the Dead
• Necromancy
• Dockside Extortionist

• Twinflame
• Phyrexian Altar
• Sol Ring
• Rakdos Signet
• Talisman of Indulgence
• Swamp
• Mountain
• Command Tower
• Blood Crypt
• Luxury Suite
• Smoldering Marsh
Focus: A Rakdos reanimator combo that uses Worldgorger Dragon + Animate Dead to
generate infinite mana (and infinite loops). The AI should note the danger of the Worldgorger
combo and how it produces infinite mana (and typically ends by animating a different creature to
break the loop). It tests if the AI flags the combo and doesn't just describe the deck as generic
reanimator or Prosper treasure-value without mentioning the loop.
• "Bomberman" Infinite Mana (Mono-White) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Teshar,
Ancestor's Apostle):
• Auriok Salvagers
• Lion's Eye Diamond
• Sun Titan
• Archaic Denison (fictional card as filler)
• Scrapyard Recombiner
• Walking Ballista
• Skullclamp
• Mishra's Bauble
• Salvage Scout
• Karmic Guide
9
• Buried Ruin
• Enlightened Tutor
• Ranger-Captain of Eos
• Silence
• Sol Ring
• Pearl Medallion
• Mind Stone
• Ancient Den
• Buried Ruin
• Plains
• Plains
• Plains
• Plains
• Plains
Focus: A mono-white combo deck showcasing the classic Bomberman combo (Auriok Salvagers +
Lion's Eye Diamond for infinite mana). It tests the AI's ability to identify the infinite mana +
Ballista kill in a deck that might otherwise look like a value or artifact-based strategy. It also
checks if the AI notes any unique win conditions or lock pieces (like Ranger-Captain to protect
the combo).
• Najeela Extra Combats (5-Color) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Najeela, the Blade-
Blossom):
• Druids' Repository
• Nature's Will
• Bear Umbra
• Aggravated Assault
• Sword of Feast and Famine
• Snapdragon Snarecaster (fictional filler creature)
• Combat Celebrant
• Derevi, Empyrial Tactician
• Brave the Sands
• Patriarch's Bidding
• Grand Abolisher
• Vampiric Tutor
• Silence
• Reconnaissance
• Sol Ring
• Arcane Signet
• Birds of Paradise
• Command Tower
• City of Brass
• Mana Confluence
• Plateau
• Savannah
• Tropical Island
• Underground Sea
• Badlands
Focus: A 5-color Najeela deck built for infinite combat phases (using cards like Nature's Will or
Druids' Repository plus Najeela, or Aggravated Assault with enough attackers). It checks if the
10
AI recognizes the infinite combat combo and the fact that Najeela's warrior token generation
fuels that combo. The AI should not confuse this for a simple Warrior tribal deck without noting
the combo potential.
Aggro/Voltron Archetype
• Mono-White Tokens (Go-wide Aggro) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Adeline,
Resplendent Cathar):
• Soul Warden
• Esper Sentinel
• Mother of Runes
• Raise the Alarm
• Recruiter of the Guard
• Spectral Procession
• Cathars' Crusade
• Crusade
• Glorious Anthem
• Mentor of the Meek
• Elspeth, Sun's Champion
• Skullclamp
• Pearl Medallion
• Secure the Wastes
• Windbrisk Heights
• Sol Ring
• Plains ×8
• Ancient Tomb
• Emeria, the Sky Ruin
Focus: A wide mono-white token swarm strategy to test curve analysis and whether the AI
correctly identifies a go-wide aggro plan. It ensures the AI notes the mass creature generation
and pumping (e.g. Cathars' Crusade) and doesn't get confused by the presence of a high-cost
Planeswalker (Elspeth) in what is fundamentally an aggressive deck.
• Goblin Tribal Aggro (Mono-Red) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Krenko, Mob Boss):
• Goblin Lackey
• Goblin Warchief
• Goblin Chieftain
• Goblin Piledriver
• Legion Loyalist
• Mogg War Marshal
• Goblin Recruiter
• Siege-Gang Commander
• Krenko's Command
• Impact Tremors
• Mob Justice
• Goblin Grenade
• Throne of the God-Pharaoh
• Skullclamp
• Cavalcade of Calamity
• Goblin King
• Mountain ×15
11
• Forgotten Cave
Focus: A Goblin tribal swarm deck to test recognition of tribal synergies (goblin lords, token
generators, direct damage from goblins). Ensures the AI notes the rapid creature production and
damage amplifiers, properly classifying it as a fast aggro strategy and not missing how cards like
Skullclamp supercharge the swarm with card draw.
• Elf Tribal "Elfball" (Mono-Green) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Ezuri, Renegade
Leader):
• Llanowar Elves
• Elvish Mystic
• Fyndhorn Elves
• Elvish Archdruid
• Imperious Perfect
• Elvish Champion
• Priest of Titania
• Marwyn, the Nurturer
• Joraga Warcaller
• Craterhoof Behemoth
• Overrun
• Regal Force
• Natural Order
• Green Sun's Zenith
• Beast Within
• Forest ×12
• Wirewood Lodge
• Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx
Focus: An Elf tribal deck that floods the board and generates explosive mana, aiming to Overrun
opponents with a Craterhoof finisher. Tests if the AI identifies the ramp-to-finisher pattern (lots
of elf mana into Craterhoof Behemoth) and correctly tags it as aggressive, rather than mislabeling
it as purely combo or missing the one-turn kill potential.
• Equipment Voltron (Boros) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Wyleth, Soul of Steel):
• Colossus Hammer
• Sword of Fire and Ice
• Sunforger
• Swiftfoot Boots
• Darksteel Plate
• Loxodon Warhammer
• Sigarda's Aid
• Puresteel Paladin
• Sram, Senior Edificer
• Open the Armory
• Steelshaper's Gift
• Danitha Capashen, Paragon
• Brass Squire
• Bloodforged Battle-Axe
• Helm of the Host
• Plains ×5
12
• Mountain ×5
• Ancient Den
• Great Furnace
• Command Tower
Focus: A Voltron deck where the commander is suited up with numerous equipments. This tests
if the AI understands the single-threat game plan and notes the heavy equipment synergy
(Wyleth drawing cards from equipped attacks), instead of misidentifying the deck due to its low
creature count.
• Aura Voltron (Naya) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Uril, the Miststalker):
• Rancor
• Ethereal Armor
• Daybreak Coronet
• Bear Umbra
• Snake Umbra
• Unflinching Courage
• Ancestral Mask
• Shield of the Oversoul
• Spirit Mantle
• Kor Spiritdancer
• Mesa Enchantress
• Satyr Enchanter
• Idyllic Tutor
• Open the Armory
• Forest ×4
• Mountain ×2
• Plains ×4
• Command Tower
• Fire-Lit Thicket
• Wooded Bastion
• Rugged Prairie
Focus: A Voltron aura deck focusing on piling enchantments onto a single hexproof creature
(Uril). It checks if the AI notes the strategy of a single massive attacker buffered by auras and life-
gain, rather than getting confused by the lack of board spread. The AI should recognize the
protective pieces (totem armor, Uril's inherent hexproof) and the all-in nature of this deck.
• Demon Stompy Aggro (Rakdos) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Rakdos, Lord of Riots):
• Cryptbreaker
• Bloodsoaked Champion
• Lightning Skelemental
• Spawn of Mayhem
• Heartless Hidetsugu
• Sulfuric Vortex
• Fiery Confluence
• Anger
• Torpor Orb
• Sire of Insanity
13
• Vilis, Broker of Blood
• Seething Song
• Dark Ritual
• Lightning Bolt
• Swamp ×6
• Mountain ×6
• Bloodfell Caves
• Command Tower
• Graven Cairns
• Rakdos Signet
• Sol Ring
Focus: A Rakdos aggro deck that aims to drop opponents' life totals quickly to enable casting
huge creatures for cheap (via Rakdos's ability). Tests whether the AI recognizes the plan of
dealing early damage to power out big threats (like Vilis) and correctly identifies this as an
aggressive deck with a top-end payoff, rather than as a midrange or purely suicidal black deck.
• Gruul Smash with Off-Color Card (RG Illegal) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander:
Xenagos, God of Revels):
• Boros Charm(off-color)
• Ghalta, Primal Hunger
• Worldspine Wurm
• Ilharg, the Raze-Boar
• Spellbreaker Behemoth
• Selvala, Heart of the Wilds
• Rhythm of the Wild
• Decimate
• Blasphemous Act
• Garruk's Uprising
• Gruul War Chant
• Lightning Greaves
• Gruul Signet
• Command Tower
• Forest ×5
• Mountain ×5
• Stomping Ground
• Gruul Turf
• Mossfire Valley
Focus: A Gruul beatdown deck with huge creatures and double-power effects from Xenagos. It
intentionally includes an off-color card (Boros Charm requiring white mana) that's outside the
commander's red-green identity. This test checks whether the AI flags the color identity
violation (illegal card inclusion) while evaluating the straightforward aggressive strategy.
• Mono-Red Aggro with Hybrid Mana Trap (Illegal) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander:
Torbran, Thane of Red Fell):
• Figure of Destiny(hybrid R/W, off-color)
• Goblin Guide
• Monastery Swiftspear
14
• Eidolon of the Great Revel
• Thermo-Alchemist
• Harsh Mentor
• Lightning Bolt
• Chain Lightning
• Price of Progress
• Flame Rift
• Sulfuric Vortex
• Fireblast
• Rite of Flame
• Skullscar Mage (fictional filler burn spell)
• Ruby Medallion
• Mountain ×15
• Ramunap Ruins
• Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle
Focus: A mono-red burn deck that sneaks in a hybrid-mana creature (Figure of Destiny, with a
white mana upgrade cost) illegal for a mono-red commander. This tests the AI's handling of color
identity errors. It should flag Figure of Destiny as an illegal inclusion while recognizing the deck's
burn-based aggressive plan (amplified by Torbran's damage bonus).
• Evasive Creatures with Duplicate (Simic) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Edric,
Spymaster of Trest):
• Flying Men
• Slither Blade (×2 – duplicate)
• Mist-Cloaked Herald
• Triton Shorestalker
• Invisible Stalker
• Blighted Agent
• Wingcrafter
• Wildborn Preserver
• Curious Obsession
• Coastal Piracy
• Bident of Thassa
• Nature's Will
• Cyclonic Rift
• Mystical Tutor
• Island ×6
• Forest ×5
• Command Tower
• Tropical Island
• Breeding Pool
• Simic Signet
• Sol Ring
Focus: A Simic tempo deck full of small evasive creatures to abuse Edric's ability (drawing cards
when creatures hit opponents). It deliberately includes a duplicate card (Slither Blade listed
twice) to test enforcement of the singleton rule in Commander. The AI should catch the duplicate
and identify the deck's low-curve evasive aggro plan, rather than overlooking the illegal
duplication or mislabeling the deck as control due to the card-draw elements.
15
• Creature-Heavy Beatdown (Gruul) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Ruric Thar, the
Unbowed):
• Ulvenwald Tracker
• Scavenging Ooze
• Shifting Ceratops
• Glorybringer
• Inferno Titan
• Ghalta, Primal Hunger
• Terastodon
• Bane of Progress
• Avenger of Zendikar
• Beast Within
• Hull Breach
• Rhythm of the Wild
• Gruul War Chant
• Lightning Greaves
• Sol Ring
• Gruul Signet
• Thran Dynamo
• Forest ×6
• Mountain ×5
• Command Tower
• Kessig Wolf Run
• Rootbound Crag
Focus: A Gruul beatdown deck with almost all creature spells, leveraging Ruric Thar's
punishment of noncreature spells. It checks that the AI picks up on the theme of maximizing
creatures (and Ruric's damage effect on anyone casting spells) and doesn't mislabel it – the
presence of a few noncreature support cards (like removal) should not confuse the classification
away from "creature-heavy aggro."
• Sliver Legion Aggro (5-Color) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Sliver Overlord):
• Gemhide Sliver
• Manaweft Sliver
• Predatory Sliver
• Sinew Sliver
• Cloudshredder Sliver
• Blur Sliver
• Bonescythe Sliver
• Sliver Legion
• Megantic Sliver
• Harmonic Sliver
• Crystalline Sliver
• Ward Sliver
• Amoeboid Changeling
• Distant Melody
• Sol Ring
• Arcane Signet
• Plains ×2
16
• Island ×2
• Swamp ×2
• Mountain ×2
• Forest ×2
• Sliver Hive
• Cavern of Souls
• Ancient Ziggurat
Focus: A 5-color Sliver deck showcasing tribal synergy (all creatures share and amplify abilities).
This tests if the AI notes the across-the-board synergy and aggressive stat boosts (multiple sliver
lords stacking) and correctly evaluates it as a tribal aggro strategy, rather than misinterpreting
the deck as just a random assortment of creatures.
• Kaalia's Big Threats (Mardu) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Kaalia of the Vast):
• Iona, Shield of Emeria (banned)
• Master of Cruelties
• Balefire Dragon
• Archfiend of Despair
• Avacyn, Angel of Hope
• Rune-Scarred Demon
• Angelic Arbiter
• Utvara Hellkite
• Scourge of the Throne
• Vilis, Broker of Blood
• Lightning Greaves
• Swiftfoot Boots
• Swords to Plowshares
• Terminate
• Rakdos Signet
• Orzhov Signet
• Boros Signet
• Sol Ring
• Plains ×2
• Swamp ×2
• Mountain ×2
• Command Tower
• Nomad Outpost
• Clifftop Retreat
• Godless Shrine
Focus: A Mardu Kaalia deck that cheats huge Angels, Demons, and Dragons into play. It
deliberately includes Iona, Shield of Emeria, a card banned in Commander, to see if the AI flags
this illegal card while analyzing the deck's high-power creature strategy. The AI should focus on
how Kaalia accelerates these big threats into play and note the banned card inclusion as a critical
issue.
• Red Burn & Big Mana (Mono-Red) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Neheb, the Eternal):
• Ghitu Lavarunner
• Viashino Pyromancer
17
• Soul-Scar Mage
• Thermo-Alchemist
• Lightning Bolt
• Lava Spike
• Skewer the Critics
• Flame Rift
• Sulfuric Vortex
• Light Up the Stage
• Banefire
• Comet Storm
• Pyrohemia
• Torbran, Thane of Red Fell
• Sol Ring
• Ruby Medallion
• Mountain ×15
• Forgotten Cave
• Ramunap Ruins
• Shrine of Burning Rage
Focus: A mono-red burn deck that also leverages Neheb's ability to generate mana from damage
(to fuel big X spells like Banefire). It tests whether the AI can identify the direct damage strategy
and the plan to convert damage into huge follow-up spells, instead of misclassifying the deck's
intent. The presence of Torbran should clue the AI into the damage-doubling theme, and
Neheb's mana generation should be recognized as enabling one-turn big finishes.
• Landfall Ramp Beatdown (Gruul, Illegal Card) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander:
Omnath, Locus of Rage):
• Primeval Titan (banned)
• Lotus Cobra
• Rampaging Baloths
• Avenger of Zendikar
• Tireless Tracker
• Mina and Denn, Wildborn
• Cultivate

• Harrow
• Explosive Vegetation
• Scapeshift
• Oracle of Mul Daya
• Gruul Signet
• Sol Ring
• Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle
• Field of the Dead
• Command Tower
• Cinder Glade
• Gruul Turf
• Forest ×5
• Mountain ×5
Focus: A Gruul landfall deck that ramps hard to drop huge threats and make swarms of tokens
(Omnath makes Elementals on landfall). It includes Primeval Titan, which is banned in
18
Commander, to test the AI's detection of format illegal cards in an otherwise straightforward
ramp-aggro deck. The AI should note the heavy land ramp and landfall payoffs as the core
strategy, while flagging the banned Titan.
• Spellslinger Aggro (Izzet Wizards) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Adeliz, the Cinder
Wind):
• Delver of Secrets
• Goblin Electromancer
• Viashino Pyromancer
• Stormchaser Mage
• Nivix Cyclops
• Electrostatic Field
• Lightning Bolt
• Lightning Strike
• Wizard's Lightning
• Shock
• Opt
• Brainstorm
• Chart a Course
• Curious Obsession
• Island ×8
• Mountain ×6
• Volcanic Island
• Shivan Reef
• Swiftwater Cliffs
• Sol Ring
• Izzet Signet
Focus: An Izzet spellslinger deck that uses cheap Wizards and a flurry of burn/cantrip spells to
quickly pressure life totals, with Adeliz pumping the team for each spell. It tests if the AI correctly
sees the aggressive spell-trigger synergy (Adeliz's team buff) and does not mistake it for a
control deck. The analysis should highlight how instant and sorcery density translate into
damage via Adeliz and creatures like Electrostatic Field.
• Vampire Tribal Aggro (Mardu) – Format: Commander. Deck (Commander: Edgar Markov):
• Vampire Lacerator
• Bloodghast
• Cordial Vampire
• Stromkirk Captain
• Captivating Vampire
• Drana, Liberator of Malakir
• Sanctum Seeker
• Kalastria Highborn

• Orzhov Signet
• Rakdos Signet
• Boros Signet
• Swamp ×4
• Mountain ×2
• Plains ×2
• Command Tower
• Blood Crypt
• Godless Shrine
• Sacred Foundry
Focus: A Mardu Vampire tribal deck known for aggressive token generation (Edgar's eminence
ability) and vampire "lords" that buff the team or drain life. It checks that the AI notes the tribal
synergy and life-drain elements (e.g. Sanctum Seeker, Blood Artist) and correctly classifies it as an
aggro strategy. The AI should not confuse the incidental lifegain/life-drain for a pure lifegain
deck or overlook the fact that Edgar Markov rapidly floods the board with vampire tokens.
(The Modern and Standard test cases are organized similarly by archetype, covering banned-card inclusions,
color pie violations, archetype misclassifications, and synergy/combo recognition in those formats, for a total
of 200 test decks.)
