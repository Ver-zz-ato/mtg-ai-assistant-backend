# 🔍 Scryfall Cache System Diagnosis Report

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ **Manual prewarm works**: You successfully ran prewarm and got `{"ok":true,"warmed":13}`
- ✅ **Cache infrastructure is solid**: All code is properly using cached endpoints
- ❌ **Cache retrieval fails**: Diagnostic shows 0 test cards found despite cache having 13 entries
- ❌ **Scheduled jobs failing**: GitHub Actions can't authenticate with your app

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Cache Normalization Mismatch (LIKELY MAIN ISSUE)
The prewarm job stores 13 cards in cache, but diagnostic finds 0. This suggests:
- **Storage**: Cards are stored with normalized names (lowercase, no accents)
- **Retrieval**: Test might be using different normalization or wrong card names
- **Solution**: Enhanced diagnostic will show exact stored vs searched names

### 2. GitHub Actions Authentication Failure (CONFIRMED)
Your scheduled jobs fail because of missing repository secrets:

```yaml
# This fails if BASE_URL or CRON_KEY secrets are missing
curl -f -sS -X POST -H "x-cron-key: ${{ secrets.CRON_KEY }}" "${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}/api/cron/prewarm-scryfall"
```

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Configure GitHub Repository Secrets
1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Add these secrets:
   - **BASE_URL**: `https://your-deployed-app.vercel.app` (or wherever your app is deployed)
   - **CRON_KEY**: `your-secret-cron-key-123` (any random string)

### Fix 2: Set Environment Variable in Deploy Platform
In Vercel/Netlify/Railway, set:
- `CRON_KEY=your-secret-cron-key-123` (same value as GitHub secret)

### Fix 3: Test Cache Retrieval
1. Visit `/debug/profile-data`
2. Look for the new "🔍 Debug Info" section
3. Check if normalized test names match cached card names

## 🔄 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Scheduled Jobs
```bash
# Go to GitHub → Actions → "nightly-prewarm-and-snapshot" → "Run workflow"
# Check logs for HTTP 200 responses instead of auth errors
```

### Step 2: Verify Cache Population
```bash
# After successful job run:
# 1. Visit /debug/profile-data
# 2. Should show "Test Cards Found: >0"
# 3. Profile pages should show color pie and radar charts
```

### Step 3: Manual Cache Refresh (Temporary Fix)
```bash
# Until scheduled jobs work:
# 1. Visit /debug/profile-data
# 2. Click "Refresh Cache Now" daily
# 3. This populates cache manually
```

## 📋 Expected Results After Fixes

### Before (Current)
```
Cache Status: ❌ Issues detected
Test Cards Found: 0
Total Cache Entries: 0
Recent Cache Activity: ✅ Yes (within 7 days)
Issue: No cached card data found for test cards
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Cache Status: ✅ Working  
Test Cards Found: 8-15
Total Cache Entries: 200-400
Recent Cache Activity: ✅ Yes (within 7 days)
Issue: null
```

### Profile Pages
- ✅ Color pie charts will populate
- ✅ Radar/archetype analysis will work  
- ✅ No more Scryfall rate limiting
- ✅ Fast loading deck trends

## 🚀 Long-term Monitoring

### Daily Checks
1. **Cache Health**: Visit `/debug/profile-data` 
2. **Job Status**: Check "Scheduled Jobs Status" section
3. **GitHub Actions**: Verify nightly runs succeed

### Weekly Checks  
1. **Profile functionality**: Test color pie and radar charts
2. **Rate limiting**: Ensure no Scryfall 429 errors
3. **Cache size**: Should grow to 200-400 entries over time

## 🎯 Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Fix GitHub secrets (enables automatic cache population)
2. **Medium Priority**: Debug cache retrieval issue (may resolve itself after #1)
3. **Low Priority**: Manual cache refresh as temporary workaround

## 🆘 Emergency Workaround
If you need immediate cache population:
1. Visit `/debug/profile-data`  
2. Click "Refresh Cache Now"
3. Repeat daily until GitHub Actions are fixed
