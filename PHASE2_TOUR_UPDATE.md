# Phase 2: Onboarding Tour Update

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. Sample Deck Import - Now Redirects to Deck
**File:** `frontend/components/SampleDeckSelector.tsx`

**Change:** Always redirects to the newly imported deck immediately after successful import.

```typescript
// Always redirect to the new deck (best UX)
window.location.href = `/my-decks/${data.deck.id}`;
```

**User Experience:**
- Click "Import Selected Deck" â†’ Immediately taken to your new deck
- No more confusion or need to refresh
- Instant feedback and engagement

### 2. Onboarding Tour - Rebuilt with 8 Steps
**File:** `frontend/components/MainFeaturesTour.tsx`

**Tour ID:** Changed from `main-features-v1` to `main-features-v2` (fresh start for all users)
